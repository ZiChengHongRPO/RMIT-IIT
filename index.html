            <p>
                About my interest to IT m will be flash back my primary school time , when I always got the most of marks from last few pages , but get wrong at simple calculation . 
            “You wrong cuz you calculate wrong and like to enter the wrong number ”Its true , but that also interest me about the math ,as long as you provided in correct method and processing right , then it will product an absolute correct answer, otherwise you got mistake on that .
            It feels like that kind of myth character who symbolized wisdoms. In the following years , &#129300; I realized that math are stand as a base stone on all science subject . 
            In my mind, It can be explained as a fundamental unit of everything we can have sensed about. 
            Then the Information techology will become how we quitalify our subjective feeling , as input to math for the answer of 42 .

                <h2>Overview</h2>
                        <p>
                            The summery of my project idea is modularized local group (MLG) , it made by Sensor Group (SG) and main processor (MP) .
                             SG can transmit simple signal to MP without internet supporting to achieve offline function. Where MP can be the app form you own device or linked outset ,even your device itself . 
                             MLG is set to suit the time of IoTs and the increasing worriers about privacy. Base on the idea of our creature adapts us and not opposite,
                             the target group would be aimed to most normal family, young groups, small enterprise and some public environment.

                        <p>
                            For anything that can connected to internet would be called as Internet of Things (IoT). 
                            There are research point out that ,from 2020 to 2025 ,There will be 146% increase of IoT related devices in short 5 years.(Ivano·B ,Karen·R & Noura·A , 2020)
                            When out technology developing in top speed, People start worry about their privacy issues,
                            although there are nothing they can do or believe from internet other than accept it.  


                            Which named as Privacy paradox. 
                            A adapt problem between individual and our creature. 
                            And MLG could stand as transitional program for this , and further potential applications .

                <h2>Description</h2>
                        <p>
                            <b><i>The</i></b> idea of MLG, is based on SGs, They have. 
                            Shape of small tags, a screen at center, status light next to it, and two or three button at other side ,like a tag. 
                            What SGs need to do is detect the change of specific environment and send the filtrated valid data to MP. 
	                        <br>
                            <br><b><i>SGs</i></b> have a shape like a smaller PSP (a handheld game console) that have detect screen at middle, status light and control button at two side .
                            SG are predicted have a size as tags. Two status button shows the situation of working and connecting. 
                            And three button for turn on and turn off ; set Bluetooth or similar link to MP ; Reset the ongoing SG data .
                            combine the long push and three button , it can also able to : switch the model ; reset/debug the SG system as factory setting. 
	                        
                            <br><b><i>Another</i></b> thing about SGs, is there are several factors that it will looking for, temperature: motion and pressure. Consider with some special situation, the sensor can also replace to a bigger button or other functions.
                            <br>
                            <br><b><i>After</i></b>
                            that, MP will star to work, , Normally MP would be an application in mobile or a physical pad, it will display the visualized result on front pages .
                            In some special case , your personal mobile or PC can be the directly receive the sign from SGs ,
                            The main function of MP is collecting the data from SGs , and processing as the name of Main processer, more exactly , 
                                the data from SGs are actually used as variables putted into the function in MP, then MP will show out the result in user’s language .
                            Normally MP would be an application in mobile or a physical pad, it will display the visualized result on front pages , it also where you can have check the statues of every linked SGs , they are placed as different modules , More exactly , the data from SGs are actually the variables in function ,Hence it allows to modularize the function in system ,
	                        Its where you can check the status of every single SG , change the main functions, follow the guide book within MP can send the command to SGs ,remotely switch the function of SG, change the filter value , reset the data , restart the function on it or simply turn it off. 
	                        <br>
                            <br>
                            All the function in MLG can only detect the exist of object or behaviors and all data can working , That’s how does it done the job of personal privacy ,And There are some example of application for MLG ,
                            
                            <span>

                                        A used MLG and set a pressure SG on his head phone rack, and linked it with his head phone or computer. 
                                        Every time he put the headphone on rack for 30 seconds, SG will send a signal to his computer and headphone that will switch them to sleep mode.
                                        Therefore, he can live with his habit with MLG and no privacy worries.

                                        A swimming pool, have set the MLG systems, where every door to outside have a SG above ,
                                         it will counting the motion of every subject that higher than 1 meter and have temperature over 30 Fahrenheit degrees , 
                                         every went in as +1 , went out as -1, then all data will send to MP .
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                         Divide the tourist and staff as two group then count the total number, 
                                         therefore the managers could know that how many people still inside ,or where are they by counted number for each area.
                                         Thought entire process have no camera but clear with locations.

                                        A SG from MLG has been set inside above the public bins,
                                         when there are high temperature where detected in side , and data of fire temp will go to MP , 
                                         at samme time automatic fire extinguisher or fire alarm will be triggered by SGs to reduce the risks .
